# Plants Care Management

Plants Care Management is a web-based application designed to provide gardening enthusiasts with comprehensive information about plants, including identification, care instructions, and disease diagnosis. Leveraging advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, the system allows users to upload images of plants for identification and receive tailored recommendations for optimal plant care.

## Features
- **Plant Identification**: Users can upload images of plants to the system, which utilizes the TensorFlow library for machine learning to identify the plant species.
- **Plant Information**: Once identified, users receive detailed information about the plant, including optimal conditions for growth and care.
- **Disease Diagnosis**: If a plant exhibits signs of disease, the system will diagnose the issue and provide basic information on how to address it.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The web interface, built using the Flask framework, offers a seamless user experience, allowing users to easily navigate and access plant-related information.

## How It Works
1. **Upload Image**: Users upload images of plants they want to identify or learn more about.
2. **Machine Learning Identification**: The system employs TensorFlow for image recognition, analyzing the uploaded image to determine the plant species.
3. **Information Retrieval**: Upon identification, the system retrieves relevant information about the plant, including care instructions and potential diseases.
4. **Disease Diagnosis**: If the plant shows signs of disease, the system provides users with basic information on the detected ailment and recommended treatments.
5. **User Interaction**: Users can interact with the website to explore plant information, receive care recommendations, and diagnose plant health issues.

## Tools Used
- **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow is utilized for machine learning-based plant identification, enabling accurate recognition of plant species from images.
- **Flask**: The Flask web framework is employed for designing the website, providing a robust and flexible platform for building web applications.

## Installation
To run the Plants Care Management system locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask application using `python app.py`.
4. Access the website through your preferred web browser.
